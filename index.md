My name is {{ site.name }}, and Hi! My name is Rebecca Gerola and I am a third-year student at Cornell University. I am pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering with a minor in Robotics. 

I am eager to gain more hands-on experience and grow my knowledge within the fields I am most passionate about!

In my free time, I love long-distance running, rock climbing, journaling, and playing sudoku.
